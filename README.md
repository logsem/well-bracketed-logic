## Prerequisites

The following is a list of the necessary prerequisites produced by opam.
We recommend using opam for installing these prerequisites.
Instructions for installing Iris (coq-iris, coq-iris-heap-lang, and coq-stdpp) are available on [https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris/](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris/).
Note that in the version number of iris packages (e.g., dev.2023-02-16.2.bcedf1c7) the last part, after the last dot, is the hash of the exact commit of iris that is installed.
This might be useful should you want to install Iris by compiling the source code yourself.
